# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Java Exercises - UNIMORE Course

**Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Java Exercise**

## Repository Contents
This collection of exercises comes from "OOP Programming" course held by prof. Nicola Bicocchi to reinforce the understanding of OOP concepts using the Java programming language.
You can find the original repo with all instructions here: [learn-java-core](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-core)
This repository refers to the academic year 2023/2024 and contains my personal solutions of all exercises. As I make them I will post them.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/matteomalvezzi/OOP-programming-unimore.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the specific exercises directory:

    ```bash
    cd .\src\main\java\com\matteomalvezzi\OOP\ExercisesFolder\ExerciseX
    ```

3. Create a static main and insert the method you want run

     ```java
    public static void main(String[] args){
        //example:
        canBalance(new int[]{11, 1, 1, 2, 1});
    }
    ```
   
4. Alternatively, you can add and run some tests. You have to go under the folder **'.\src\test\java\com\matteomalvezzi\OOP'** and choice the test you would run.

## Additional advices

- Refer to [Bicocchi](https://github.com/nbicocchi) course materials and recommended Java documentation for a deeper understanding of OOP concepts.
- In my opinion there are several algorithms to solve an exercise, try to solve it lonely and after check if it is correct.
